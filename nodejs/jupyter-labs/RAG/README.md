the [LLM RAG for Beginners: A Practical Guide with Elasticsearch and OpenSearch](https://bonsai.io/blog)
post.

## Pre-requisites

The accompanying [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook makes use of
the [Deno Jupyter Kernel](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/jupyter/), which must
be installed prior to use!

Once installed, start your Jupyter Lab via `jupyter lab` and open up the [RAG.ipynb](./RAG.ipynb) file in the Jupyter
UI!
